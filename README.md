# Structural Variant Analysis Pipeline

This repository provides a pipeline for structural variant (SV) analysis using a combination of popular bioinformatics tools: **BWA-MEM**, **GATK**, **Manta**, **BCFtools**, **AnnotSV**, and **SVDB**. The pipeline allows users to align sequencing data, call structural variants, annotate variants, and analyze results effectively.

## Tools

1. **BWA-MEM**: A fast and accurate algorithm for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome.
2. **GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit)**: A toolkit for variant discovery in high-throughput sequencing data.
3. **Manta**: A tool for detecting structural variants from whole-genome and targeted sequencing data.
4. **BCFtools**: A set of utilities for manipulating variant calls in the BCF and VCF formats.
5. **AnnotSV**: A tool for annotating structural variants with various databases and resources.
6. **SVDB**: A database of structural variants for comprehensive analysis.

## Installation

Before using this pipeline, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Java 1.8 or higher
- Conda (for managing environments)
- Git

Clone this repository and set up the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KristinaM93/sv-analysis-pipeline.git
cd sv-analysis-pipeline
conda create -n sv-pipeline python=3.8
conda activate sv-pipeline
Tool Installation
Install the required tools using Conda or download them from their respective websites:

bash
Copy code
conda install -c bioconda bwa gatk manta bcftools annotsv
For SVDB, follow the installation instructions on the SVDB GitHub page.

Usage
To run the SV analysis pipeline, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
bash run_pipeline.sh -i <input_fastq_dir> -r <reference_genome> -o <output_dir>
Parameters
-i <input_fastq_dir>: Directory containing input FASTQ files.
-r <reference_genome>: Reference genome file (FASTA format).
-o <output_dir>: Directory for output results.
Example Workflow
Align Reads: Use BWA-MEM to align the reads to the reference genome.
Mark Duplicates: Use GATK to mark duplicate reads.
Call Variants: Use Manta to call structural variants.
Filter Variants: Use BCFtools to filter the variant calls.
Annotate Variants: Use AnnotSV to annotate the filtered variants.
Store Results: Use SVDB to store and analyze results.
Results
The output directory will contain the following files:

Aligned BAM files
Variant call files (VCF)
Annotated variant files
Summary reports
